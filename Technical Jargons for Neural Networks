filters:
--------
Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).

kernel_size: 
----------
An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the height and width of the 2D convolution window. 
Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions.

Padding :
----------
In CNNs, padding refers to the process of adding extra pixels to the input image before applying convolution. 
Acting as a protective boundary around the image, these additional pixels allow the network to retain more 
spatial information(information having location-based relation with other information). 

There are two main types of padding used in machine learning: 
same padding, valid padding,with the most generally used being the same padding

"valid" means no padding. 
"same" results in padding with zeros evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input

Note: When padding="same" and strides=1, the output has the same size as the input.


Stride :
-----------
Stride denotes how many steps we are moving in each steps in convolution.By default it is one. 
We can observe that the size of output is smaller that input. To maintain the dimension of 
output as in input , we use padding. Padding is a process of adding zeros to the input matrix symmetrically
